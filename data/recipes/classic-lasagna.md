## Ingredients

### For the Meat Sauce:

- 6 garlic cloves, minced
- 2 (28 oz) cans crushed tomatoes
- 2 tbsp tomato paste
- 2 tsp dried basil

### For the Cheese Mixture:

## Instructions

1. **Prepare the Meat Sauce:**
   In a large pot, brown the ground beef and Italian sausage over medium heat. Add onion and garlic, cooking until softened. Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, and herbs. Simmer for 30 minutes.

2. **Make the Cheese Mixture:**
   In a large bowl, combine ricotta, eggs, 1 cup Parmesan, and chopped basil. Mix well and set aside.

3. **Cook the Pasta:**
   Cook lasagna noodles according to package directions. Drain and lay flat on wax paper to prevent sticking.

4. **Layer the Lasagna:**
   Spread 1 cup of meat sauce in a 9x13 baking dish. Layer with noodles, ricotta mixture, mozzarella, and meat sauce. Repeat layers, finishing with cheese on top.

5. **Bake:**
   Cover with foil and bake at 375Â°F for 25 minutes. Remove foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes until bubbly and golden brown.

## Chef's Tips

- Let the lasagna rest for 15 minutes before serving to set properly
- Use fresh mozzarella for the top layer for the best melting quality
